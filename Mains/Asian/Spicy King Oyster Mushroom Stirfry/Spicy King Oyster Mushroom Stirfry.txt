Spicy King Oyster Mushroom Stirfry

Serves: 2
Active Time: 5min
Total Time: 13min

Ingredients:
- 12 oz/340 g king oyster mushrooms
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 cloves garlic minced
- 1 inch ginger minced
- 1 tablespoon chili bean sauce
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Green onions optional

Directions:
1. Clean the king oyster mushrooms by wiping them gently with a damp cloth. Trim the tough ends and slice them into thin strips. If you are using larger mushrooms, cut the strips in half.
2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds or until fragrant.
3. Add the sliced king oyster mushrooms to the skillet and stir-fry for approximately 3-4 minutes until they turn golden brown.
4. In a small bowl, combine Chinese chili bean sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice vinegar, and sugar. Whisk the ingredients together until well blended.
5. Pour the sauce mixture over the mushrooms in the skillet. Stir-fry for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
6. Remove the skillet from heat and garnish the dish with freshly chopped scallions. 

Notes:
- Eggplant and capsicum go very well in this too. Can separately stir-fry veggies until they start to brown and then add all into stir-fry with sauce.
