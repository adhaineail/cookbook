  <h1>Red Lentil Patties</h1>
  
  <div class="metadata">
    Serves: 25 patties<br>
    Active Time: 20min | Total Time: 40min
  </div>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups dry red lentils</li><li>1 medium white onion, diced</li><li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li><li>Â½ tablespoon chickpea flour</li><li>1 teaspoon coriander</li><li>2 tablespoons Italian seasoning</li><li>Sea salt &amp; pepper to taste</li><li>olive oil for frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Rinse and soak the red lentils in enough water to cover the top layer. They will expand, so be generous with the amount of water you use. We recommend soaking them overnight, but definitely for at least 2-3 hours.</li><li>After the lentils have soaked, drain and add them to a food processor along with the onion, garlic, tomato paste, chickpea flour, and seasonings.</li><li>Pulse everything together until you have a fairly smooth batter (it&#x27;s okay if there are some chunks, or if it seems a little runny).</li><li>Next, heat the olive or grapeseed oil in a frying pan on medium. You&#x27;ll know the oil is hot enough when you stick a wooden handle in it and you see bubbles around it.</li><li>Form 1-2 tablespoon patties in your hands, flattening them slightly. We usually cook about 5-6 patties at a time, but you can cook however many will fit in your pan. Fry them on each side for 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
