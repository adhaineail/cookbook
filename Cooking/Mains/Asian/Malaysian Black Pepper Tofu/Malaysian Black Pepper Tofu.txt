Malaysian Black Pepper Tofu

Serves: 2 - 3
Active Time: 30 min
Total Time: 45 min

Ingredients:
- 300g tofu (firm)
- Oil for deep frying
- Cornflour for coating
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 4 shallots, thinly sliced
- 2 fat cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 tablespoons black pepper, freshly ground
- 2 red birds-eye chilies, chopped
- 2 tablespoons black soy sauce
- 1 tablespoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons vegetarian oyster sauce
- Handful of fresh coriander, stalks removed

Directions:
1. Slice tofu horizontally so you have two pieces, then chop into cubes. Toss them in cornflour, shaking off the excess. In a wide frying pan, pour in enough vegetable oil to come the sides of the pan, and bring up to frying heat. Fry the tofu in batches in the oil, turning now and again so that they are golden all around, and have a thin crust, transfer to a paper towel.
2. In another pan, melt butter and put in shallots, garlic, red chilli slices. Saute till soft, then add the sauces, sugar, black pepper and heat for a couple of minutes, before gently stirring in the tofu pieces and the coriander. Cook for a minutes or so for the tofu to warm through. Serve immediately with plain white rice.

Notes:
- Use less chilli
- Can add spinach, edamame beans and cashews 
- Can use one bag of tofu puffs instead of breading and frying regular tofu, also can simply lightly brown tofu, without breading.
- Can use green chillies
- Red Capsicum goes really well
