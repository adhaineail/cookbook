  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 medium head of broccoli, cut into small/medium florets</li><li>1/2 medium head of cauliflower, cut into small/medium florets</li><li>2 large yellow onions (1 cup), diced</li><li>1 medium carrot, diced</li><li>1 4 oz tin Maesri red or panang curry paste (Unlike many other brands, many Maesri pastes do not include fish or shrimp.)</li><li>1 14oz can coconut cream or milk</li><li>1/2 cup natural peanut butter</li><li>2 Tbsp brown sugar</li><li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li><li>1 tsp curry powder (optional)</li><li>1 12oz block of tofu, cut into roughly 1/2 inch cubes</li><li>Roasted salted peanuts to garnish</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start steaming the broccoli and cauliflower. These will cook while you make the sauce.</li><li>Heat about 2 Tbsp oil in a pan.</li><li>Saute onions and carrot together until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.</li><li>Mix in a good dollop of the solid cream from the coconut milk. The fat will act as a flavor carrier and the coconut will also toast slightly. After a minute or two, when the coconut has become aromatic, add in the curry paste and peanut butter.</li><li>Keep mixing the sauce until the peanut butter is fully melted and incorporated, scraping the bottom as needed to keep it from sticking. We will then add the rest of the coconut milk, and the liquid will lift up anything that has stuck.</li><li>Add in the sugar, soy sauce and curry powder. Taste and adjust salt and sugar as needed.</li><li>Now that your sauce is done, you can add in the tofu and steamed vegetables.</li><li>Garnish with some crushed peanuts for a special salty crunch!</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can cook the vegetables right in the sauce instead of steaming separately. This will simply take longer and may require a larger pot. You may also find you need to add a little water if cooking the dish in this way. Great meal to prep ahead of time because of this.</li><li>Jasmine rice goes especially nicely with this dish. You can also add a tsp each of garlic, ginger and salt to the rice at the beginning of it cooking to make a special rice.</li>
  </ul>
