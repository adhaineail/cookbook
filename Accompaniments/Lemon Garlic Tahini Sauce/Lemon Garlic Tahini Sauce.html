  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 medium-to-large cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li><li>¼ cup lemon juice</li><li>½ cup tahini</li><li>½ teaspoon fine sea salt</li><li>Pinch of ground cumin</li><li>6 tablespoons ice water, more as needed</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a medium bowl, combine the garlic and lemon juice. Let the mixture rest for 10 minutes, to give the garlic time to infuse the lemon juice with flavor.</li><li>Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into another medium bowl. Press the garlic solids with a spatula to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the garlic.</li><li>Add the tahini, salt and cumin to the bowl. Whisk until the mixture is thoroughly blended.</li><li>Add water 2 tablespoons at a time, whisking after each addition until smooth. (It may seize up, don’t worry.) After about 6 tablespoons, you will have a perfectly creamy and smooth, light-colored tahini sauce.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lazy version, use garlic powder and cold tap water.</li><li>Can whisk in chopped fresh, leafy herbs, such as fresh parsley, cilantro, dill, or basil. If you would like more of a uniformly green sauce, just blend the herbs with the tahini sauce in a food processor or blender</li>
  </ul>
